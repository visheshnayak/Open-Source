# Open-Source
After a long time of uninteresting college life, I finally get some time to indulge in my favorite stream, and as it turns out
I am interested in open source technologies, so, here I am, uploading some of my configs that took a long time to do.

All the pros of open source out there, suggestions are welcome. ;)
